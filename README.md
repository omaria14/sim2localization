# SIM2LOCALIZATION

Localization methodology that handles map changes and poor initial guesses, based on segmentation of both source and target (simulated) scans, matching segments, and ICP refinement.

### Methodology Main Steps:

1. **Generate simulated scans**  
   Create simulated scans as target scans to represent the map.
   ‚ûú Using scan-based representations of the map makes it easier to segment it and match its segments with those of the source scan.
   ‚ûú To increase the chance of segment matches, generate multiple simulated scans around the initial pose guess with random variations.

2. **Segment both scans**  
   Segment the source scan and each simulated target scan.

3. **Create match pairs**  
   Consider all plausible combinations of source and target segments that could yield a valid global transformation:
   - Single-segment matches (`1 source ‚Üí 1 target`)
   - Multi-segment matches (`2 source ‚Üí 2 target`)
   
   Compute a global transformation for each proposed set of matches.
    ‚ûú Select the transformation with the highest total score, calculated by summing the similarity scores of the matched segments that support that transformation.

4. **Refine with ICP**  
   Run ICP using only the source segments that have a high probability of not being new or dynamic.  
   ‚ûú Apply the transformation with the highest score for the final alignment.
